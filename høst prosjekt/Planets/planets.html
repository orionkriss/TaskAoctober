                  Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it
                  (sorry Elon). The temperatures and solar radiation that
                  characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for
                  organisms to adapt to. <br />
                  <br />
                  Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient
                  Roman gods. <br />
                  <br />
                  Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled
                  swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet
                  nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury
                  has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. <br />

                  It's a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, often
                  called Earth’s twin. But pull up a bit closer, and Venus turns
                  hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet
                  from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead. The
                  atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just
                  a smear of light. <br />
                  <br />

                  Venus, the third brightest object after the Sun and Moon, was
                  named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It’s the
                  only planet named after a female god. <br />

                  The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the
                  planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman
                  gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic
                  word, which simply means “the ground.” <br />
                  <br />

                  Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals
                  that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is
                  unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water,
                  since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for
                  extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a
                  convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years
                  ago. <br />

                  Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war
                  because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other
                  civilizations also named the planet for this attribute – for
                  example, the Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the
                  red one." <br />
                  <br />
                  Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because
                  iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing
                  the surface to look red. <br />
                  <br />
                  Scientists don't expect to find living things currently
                  thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life
                  that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with
                  water. <br />

                  is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a

                  The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through
                  mathematical calculations. Using predictions made by Urbain Le
                  Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846. The
                  planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested
                  by Le Verrier.<br />
                  <br />
                  Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it.
                  The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize
                  this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for
                  organisms to adapt to.<br />
