            Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has
            provided a dazzling array of images that have awed and inspired the
            public. But Hubble's about far more than just pretty pictures. The
            mission has gathered dozens of terabytes of data over the decades,
            providing key insights into the universe, from objects as close as
            the moon to the most remote galaxies, with observations of
            supernovas and nebulas in between.<br />
            <br />
            Launched from space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990, the Hubble
            Space Telescope orbits at an altitude of about 350 miles (560
            kilometers). The telescope is 43.5 feet (13.2 meters) long, weighs
            24,500 pounds (11,110 kilograms) and cost $2.5 billion.<br />
            <br />
            Hubbleâ€™s six cameras and sensors see visible, infrared and
            ultraviolet light. At the heart of Hubble is its 8-foot-diameter
            (2.4 meters) primary mirror. The Hubble telescope is named after the
            famed late astronomer Edwin Hubble, who has been lauded as the
            father of modern cosmology and determined the rate of the expansion
            of the universe. <br />
